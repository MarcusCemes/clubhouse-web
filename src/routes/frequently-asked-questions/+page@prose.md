# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there a mobile application?

Clubhouse does not have a dedicated native application, however the forum
website **can be installed as a PWA application**, with almost near-native
functionality, such as a homescreen icon and push notifications.

If you are logged in and have reached a Trust Level of 1 or more, the forum will
show a one-time banner at the top of the screen prompting you to install the
application.

If you have accidentally dismissed the banner, don't worry, you can always add
install the application manually as long as you have
[met certain interaction criteria](https://web.dev/install-criteria/), such as
having interacted with the page for at least 30 seconds.

1. Navigate to the [forum]({FORUM_URL}) in your
   mobile browser.

2. Install the application manually:
   - **iOS (Safari)**: Share > Add to Home Screen
   - **iOS (Firefox, Chrome)**: _Not supported_
   - **Android (Firefox, Chrome)**: Settings > Add to Home Screen

## How do I close my account?

Get in touch with us at
[{CONTACT_ADDRESS}](mailto:{CONTACT_ADDRESS}) with your request
using your student address. We will remove all personal data from our database
and anonymise your forum account.

In exceptional circumstances, the forum account _may_ be deleted instead of just
anonymised, however, this is left as a last resort as it will erase history by
effectively deleting other user's replies relating to your own posts or
comments.

Once your account has been anonymised, it will no longer be possible to delete
the account unless you are able to provide proof of your past ownership of the
account.
