# About Clubhouse

Clubhouse is a student-run initiative that aims to create a dynamic community of
students and EPFL members.

From our experience, EPFL schools, especially the larger ones, do an excellent
job at creating communities and resources, such as annual aggregates on Google
Drive, lively Discord servers and WhatsApp/Telegram groups containing hundreds
of users (which can quickly get out of hand!).

We would like to keep it this way, but provide an overseeing platform to bring
together these different resources and communities, whilst adding something new
that wasn't possible before.

## Why Clubhouse?

- **Event emails are transactional**, suited for broadcasts. We've also
  trained ourselves to immediately delete them for the most part.
- **IM groups are for informal chats** and only provide a single thread of
  communication. They are also often monopolised break down when more people
  are involved.
- **Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Slack, $PLATFORM are proprietary** and
  not very flexible. This gives us complete freedom to design our space. They
  also require accounts and not everyone wants to make one.
- **Clubhouse is integrated with Tequila**, it's as easy as logging into
  Moodle!
- We **respect the data of our users** and don't seek financial gain.

## Our goals

- **Provide a centralised platform** to find out about what's going on at
  EPFL, as well as interact with the community as a whole.
- **Create a social space** where students can ask questions, get help,
  discuss ideas, and make decisions.
- **Help reduce the large number of association-related emails** that clog up
  inboxes. We want to help you be heard, without having to apologise to users
  for spam.
- **Give each school its own dedicated space** to aid discoverability of
  private communities and resources as well as external users to find
  school-specific groups for targeted events.

## Our vision

- Create a place that the EPFL community recognises as a space for veritable
  announcements, discussion and discovery.
- Experiment with custom features that are unique to our environment. How
  about anonymously finding someone like-minded to have lunch with and
  exchange experiences? Or perhaps find a passionate co-worker for a project
  idea?
- Get official sponsorship from EPFL to keep to keep it going for years to
  come, maintained and made better by future EPFL generations.
